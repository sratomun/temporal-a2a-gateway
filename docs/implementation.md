# Implementation Guide

## Architecture Overview

The Temporal A2A Gateway implements the A2A protocol specification using Temporal as the core orchestration engine. This design provides several key advantages for production multi-agent systems.

### Core Components

#### A2A Gateway
The gateway serves as the primary protocol endpoint, implementing the JSON-RPC 2.0 interface defined in the A2A specification. It handles:

- Protocol request validation and routing
- Task lifecycle management
- Agent registry integration
- Error handling and response formatting
- Metrics collection and tracing

#### Temporal Integration
Temporal provides the workflow orchestration layer with the following benefits:

- **Durability**: All task state is persisted, allowing recovery from failures
- **Reliability**: Automatic retries with configurable policies
- **Scalability**: Distributed execution across multiple worker processes
- **Observability**: Built-in workflow tracking and debugging tools

#### Agent Workers
Workers are Temporal workflow implementations that execute agent logic. Each agent type corresponds to a specific workflow and task queue configuration.

### Request Flow

1. **Client Request**: JSON-RPC 2.0 request received at `/a2a` endpoint
2. **Validation**: Request structure and parameters validated against A2A specification
3. **Routing**: Agent ID mapped to Temporal task queue using routing configuration
4. **Workflow Start**: Temporal workflow initiated with normalized input
5. **Execution**: Agent worker processes the task
6. **Response**: Result returned to client via JSON-RPC response

### Task Lifecycle

#### Task States
- `running`: Task has been submitted to Temporal and is executing
- `completed`: Task finished successfully with result
- `failed`: Task execution failed with error information
- `cancelled`: Task was explicitly cancelled before completion

#### State Transitions
```
[Client Request] → running → {completed|failed|cancelled}
```

Tasks progress through these states as managed by the Temporal workflow engine.

### Storage Systems

#### Redis Integration
Redis serves multiple functions in the implementation:

- **Task Caching**: Fast lookup of task status and results
- **Metadata Indexing**: Queryable indexes for task discovery
- **Session Management**: Temporary data storage during execution

Key Redis patterns:
- Task data: `task:{task_id}` (hash)
- Status index: `tasks:by_status:{status}` (set)
- Creation index: `tasks:by_created` (sorted set)
- Metadata index: `tasks:by_metadata:{key}:{value}` (set)

#### Temporal Persistence
Temporal maintains the authoritative state of all workflows and provides:

- Workflow history and event logging
- Automatic retry and recovery mechanisms
- Cross-worker state synchronization

### Error Handling

The implementation extends the A2A specification with a comprehensive error classification system organized into categories:

#### Standard JSON-RPC Errors
- `-32700`: Parse error
- `-32600`: Invalid request
- `-32601`: Method not found
- `-32602`: Invalid params
- `-32603`: Internal error

#### A2A Protocol Extensions
- Task management errors (`40000-40099`)
- Agent management errors (`40100-40199`)
- Authentication/authorization errors (`40200-40299`)
- Service integration errors (`40300-40399`)
- Validation errors (`40400-40499`)

Each error includes structured metadata for debugging and monitoring.

### Observability

#### Metrics
OpenTelemetry integration provides:

- Request latency and throughput metrics
- Task creation and completion rates
- Error rates by category
- Resource utilization tracking

#### Tracing
Distributed tracing spans across:

- Gateway request processing
- Temporal workflow execution
- Agent worker operations
- External service calls

#### Health Monitoring
Health endpoints provide real-time status of:

- Gateway service health
- Temporal connection status
- Redis connectivity
- Agent registry availability

## Design Decisions

### Why Temporal for A2A
The choice of Temporal as the orchestration engine addresses several challenges in multi-agent systems:

1. **Durability Requirements**: Agent tasks may run for extended periods and must survive system failures
2. **Complex Workflows**: Multi-agent interactions often involve intricate coordination patterns
3. **Scalability Needs**: Production systems require horizontal scaling of agent execution
4. **Observability**: Operations teams need visibility into agent task execution

### Protocol Compliance
The implementation maintains strict compliance with the A2A specification while adding production-necessary extensions. All extensions are clearly documented and optional for basic protocol compatibility.

### Configuration Management
YAML-based agent routing provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios while maintaining type safety and validation.
