# Architecture Assets

This directory contains architectural design documents, diagrams, and analysis artifacts for the Temporal A2A Gateway project.

## Directory Structure

- `analysis/` - Architectural analysis and assessment documents
- `design/` - Design decisions and architectural patterns
- `diagrams/` - System architecture diagrams and visual representations
- `specifications/` - Technical specifications and compliance documentation

## Key Documents

### Sprint 1 Foundation
- **Analysis**: Complete architectural assessment from Agent 1 (Architect)
- **Compliance**: A2A v0.2.5 protocol compliance validation
- **Implementation**: Technical design decisions and patterns

### Sprint 2 Preparation
- **Streaming Architecture**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) design for `message/stream`
- **Scalability**: Performance and scaling considerations
- **Integration**: Agent ecosystem expansion planning

## Agent Collaboration

This directory serves as the central repository for architectural artifacts generated through multi-agent collaboration:

- **Agent 1 (Architect)**: System design and analysis
- **Agent 5 (Standardization)**: A2A protocol compliance validation  
- **Agent 6 (Project Manager)**: Implementation planning and coordination

## Usage

Architectural assets in this directory inform:
1. Implementation decisions for development team
2. Compliance validation against A2A specification
3. System scalability and performance planning
4. Production deployment architecture
