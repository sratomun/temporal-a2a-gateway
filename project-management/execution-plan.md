# Temporal A2A Gateway - Execution Plan

## Sprint 5: Real-time Webhook Streaming (Week 6-7)

### Executive Summary
Sprint 5 implements webhook-based real-time streaming to solve the fundamental limitation that Temporal activities must complete before returning data. This enables true real-time chunk delivery with <50ms latency.

### Sprint Goals
1. **Webhook Infrastructure**: Gateway endpoint for receiving chunks from activities
2. **Enhanced StreamingContext**: HTTP POST delivery instead of batch collection
3. **SDK Integration**: Seamless webhook support in Temporal A2A SDK
4. **Performance Achievement**: Sub-50ms latency for real-time delivery
5. **Production Hardening**: Retry logic, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms

### Technical Architecture

#### Gateway Webhook Endpoint
```go
// POST /internal/webhook/stream
type StreamChunkRequest struct {
    TaskID      string `json:"task_id"`
    Chunk       string `json:"chunk"`
    Sequence    int    `json:"sequence"`
    IsLast      bool   `json:"is_last"`
    ArtifactID  string `json:"artifact_id"`
}
```

#### Activity Streaming Flow
```
Activity → HTTP POST → Gateway Webhook → Route by TaskID → SSE Stream → Client
   ↓                        ↓                                    ↓
Generate              Validate HMAC                        Real-time
 Chunk                & Task Active                         Delivery
```

### Success Criteria
- **Latency**: <50ms per chunk (measured end-to-end)
- **Throughput**: 1,000 concurrent streams stable
- **Reliability**: 99.9% chunk delivery rate
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to batch mode
- **Security**: HMAC authentication functional
- **Documentation**: Complete integration guide

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
1. **Network Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Fallback: Batch collection mode

2. **Gateway Overload**
   - Mitigation: Connection pooling, efficient routing
   - Fallback: Rate limiting, back-pressure

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Mitigation: Internal network only, HMAC auth
   - Validation: Task ID verification

### Performance Targets

#### Latency Budget (50ms total)
- Network hop: 10ms
- Gateway processing: 5ms
- SSE delivery: 20ms
- Buffer/overhead: 15ms

#### Scale Targets
- 1,000 concurrent streams: Required
- 10,000 concurrent streams: Stretch goal
- 100K req/sec: Gateway capacity

### Monitoring & Metrics
- Webhook latency histogram
- Delivery success rate
- Fallback activation rate
- Stream concurrency gauge
- Error rate by type

### Deliverables
1. Working webhook streaming implementation
2. Updated SDK with webhook support
3. Performance test results
4. Integration documentation
5. Production deployment guide

### Sprint Timeline
- **Week 6**: Implementation and integration
- **Week 7**: Testing, hardening, documentation
- **Demo**: End of Week 7 - Live streaming demonstration

### Next Sprint Preview
Sprint 6 will focus on enterprise features including authentication, rate limiting, and security hardening, building on the webhook infrastructure.
