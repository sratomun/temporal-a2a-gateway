## Risk Tracking

### High Risk Items
1. **Streaming Implementation (Sprint 2)** - Technical complexity
2. **Authentication Integration (Sprint 3)** - Security requirements
3. **Performance Under Load (Sprint 4)** - Scalability validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Webhook streaming with retry mechanisms for reliability
- Standard JWT patterns for authentication
- Leverage Temporal's proven scalability features

### Contingency Plans
- Streaming: Fall back to SSE if webhook implementation blocked
- Authentication: Phase implementation if integration issues arise
- Performance: Horizontal scaling with Temporal workers as needed
