## Risk Tracking

### High Risk Items
1. **Streaming Implementation (Sprint 2)** - Technical complexity
2. **Authentication Integration (Sprint 3)** - Security requirements
3. **Performance Under Load (Sprint 4)** - Scalability validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- SSE-first approach for streaming reduces complexity
- Standard JWT patterns for authentication
- Leverage Temporal's proven scalability features

### Contingency Plans
- Streaming: Fall back to polling if SSE implementation blocked
- Authentication: Phase implementation if integration issues arise
- Performance: Horizontal scaling with Temporal workers as needed
